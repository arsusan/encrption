    This program uses the Caesar cipher algorithm, which is a very basic encryption algorithm. 
    While it may be sufficient for some basic purposes, it is not recommended for sensitive or high-security data.
    When using this program, you should always keep your encryption key safe and secure.
    
    If someone gains access to your key, they can easily decrypt your encrypted data.
     Before running the program, make sure you have a backup of your original data. 
    If something goes wrong during the encryption or decryption process, you may lose your data permanently.

    When prompted to enter the input and output file names, make sure you enter the correct file names and file paths. 
    If the file names or paths are incorrect, the program will fail to open the files.

    If you are encrypting a large file, the program may take some time to complete. 
    Be patient and allow the program to finish before attempting to access the encrypted file.

    Make sure to choose the correct option (1 for encryption or 2 for decryption) when prompted. 
    If you choose the wrong option, the program may produce unexpected results.

    Finally, remember that this program is just a basic example and should not be used for real-world encryption and decryption purposes.
    For more secure encryption, you should use more advanced algorithms, such as AES or RSA.
